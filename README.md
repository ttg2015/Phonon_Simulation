# Phonon_Simulation
Phonon Simulations to practice physics, as well as coding
In this project I am to write a collection of codes that simulate phonon propogation in a lattice. Progress will begin in python with 1D simple, 1D complicated, 2-3D simple, and 2-3D complicated. Following this I will then move to explore porting this code to CUDA, and/or accelerating python with a GPU
